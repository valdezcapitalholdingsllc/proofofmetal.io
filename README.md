🪙 Why Proof Of Metal Exists

Crypto moves fast, but trust is still the missing ingredient.

Proof Of Metal exists to bring clarity, transparency, and real-world grounding to digital markets—starting with assets tied to physical precious metals.

1) Liquidity + trust problems are real

Thin liquidity, fragmented venues, and hype-driven cycles make it difficult to separate signal from noise.
Prices can move without depth, transparency varies by venue, and narratives often outweigh fundamentals.

Proof Of Metal focuses on observable market data—not promotion.

2) Markets are going 24/7 and token-first

Trading is migrating to always-on, digital rails.

Tokenized assets trade continuously across centralized and decentralized venues. Proof Of Metal helps track these markets in real time using transparent, verifiable sources—
no narratives, no spin, no incentives.

3) Bridging digital value to physical ownership

Real-world assets are becoming tokenized.

The long-term vision is simple:

Track digital claims tied to physical precious metals

Monitor holdings like an inventory, not just a price

Support long-term and generational planning, including family trust use cases

Core Principle

Crypto becomes more trustworthy when it’s tied to something real—
something you can possess, store, and verify.

Proof Of Metal is built to help close the gap between digital markets and physical reality.
